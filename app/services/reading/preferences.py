"""Preference write helpers.

`upsert_preference` is the single write path into the `preference` table.
It enforces:
  - read-modify-write (so the user's other preferences are preserved)
  - "no write if the value is unchanged" short-circuit (avoids spurious
    UPDATEs when the user clicks the same button twice)
  - ATTRIBUTE.flag_modified so SQLAlchemy detects the in-place dict edit

Per-key + per-value validation against PREFERENCE_OPTIONS happens at the
route layer; this helper trusts its inputs.
