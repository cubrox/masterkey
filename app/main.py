    Top-level browser navigation gets a 303 to / (the landing page,
    which serves the sign-in form). HTMX requests (intercepted by
    HTMX before the browser sees them) get a 200 with an
    `HX-Redirect: /` header — HTMX reads that header and performs a
    client-side redirect. Without this branch, HTMX would swallow
    the 303 and the user's URL bar wouldn't change.

    Note: the redirect target is `/`, not `/login`. `/login` is a
    POST-only API endpoint that handles form submission, not a page.
    Sending unauthenticated visitors to a POST-only endpoint via GET
    would land them on a 405 Method Not Allowed. The landing page at
    `/` is the actual sign-in entry point — visiting it shows the
    form whose submit handler hits `/login`.
