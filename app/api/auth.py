"""Sign-in routes via Supabase Auth (GoTrue magic-link).

POST /login: hands the email to Supabase, which mints a magic-link
token and emails it. Returns a generic 202 fragment — the same fragment
regardless of whether the email exists, so the route can't be used for
account enumeration (Supabase's `should_create_user=True` default does
the same on the auth side).

GET /auth/callback: two-stage handler.

  1. First hit (no query params): Supabase puts the JWT in the URL
     hash fragment (`#access_token=...&refresh_token=...`), which the
     browser does NOT send to the server. We render a tiny JS page
     that reads `window.location.hash`, converts to query params, and
     redirects to the same path with those tokens visible to the
     server.
  2. Second hit (query params present): validate the access_token via
     Supabase, set it as an HttpOnly cookie, redirect to the app.

GET /logout: clears both cookies (sb-access-token AND the legacy
session cookie) and signs out of Supabase.

The legacy `User` SQLModel is still alive — see the transitional
shim in `app/services/identity/session.py`. SUPA-2b (#87) removes it.
